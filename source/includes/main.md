# Introduction

Welcome to the Brydge API! You can use our API to access Brydge API endpoints, which can process payments, create digital banks and more easily.

We have language bindings only in Javascript (yet)! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

***We want to build bridges, not walls!***

## How to read this documentation?

Thinking about the best to our clients, we created this documentation as we would have liked if we were in your side, as client trying to connect with us. So, we have some tips to help you to absorb this content easily and faster.

### Use the Searchable Menu
In your left we have a good menu that we can even search for topics. Feel free to use it!

### Content split into Entities
We split the content into Entities and they are linked, sometimes. For example:

- Go to **Payments -> Regular Payment**
- You are going to see that a **Regular Payment requests a Customer Token**.
- Now, you are wondering `How to get a Customer Token?`. That's a clever question!
- So, you go to **Customer -> Basic**. Over there, you gonna see how to **Create a Customer** and **how this request returns a Customer token**. Problem solved.

Definitely, `Navigate through the Entities` it's a great tip.

### We provide examples
```javascript
const help = "Hi, I'm an example! Don't forget to pay attention to me!"
```

We provide examples to help you to connect with us faster. Pay attention to them!

### Don't worry, we won't be offline
Sometimes we want to understand every detail in the first read. Don't worry, you can get back here later. Use this documentation as a manual.
