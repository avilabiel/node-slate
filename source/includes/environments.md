# Environments

Brydge API has two different environments: Sandbox and Production. The endpoints are equal on both environments, except the beginning of their URLs.

## Sandbox
**URL**: `https://<microservice>.brydge.com.br`

## Production
**URL**: `https://<microservice>.brydge.io`

## Microservices
We have different microservices in our architecture, and we have many reasons to do that, only thinking to provide a great service to our clients. Don't worry, we will guide you on each request!
